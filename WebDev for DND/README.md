
I am utilizing flask to route webpages and connect them using python, may need help with integrating python code for databases entry


File contents- 

    app.py - sets up flask systems

    views.py - contains routes to pages

    templates folder - contains html files to different pages

    static folder - contains both the JavaScript and the CSS files for the html


to view in working dev webpage : 

    create python environment
        CTRL + Shift + P
        select, Python: Create Environment...
        match selection to files already here (.venv) 

    open your own terminal
        CTRL + Shift + `

    use the following commands
        python -m pip install flask
        python -m flask run

if this does not work it is most definently my fault somehow :D
